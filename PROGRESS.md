# Current Project Progress

This document summarizes the present state of the Overseer project and outlines next steps for continued development. Little overseer agents can reference this summary to understand where work is needed.

## Completed Milestones

- **Action skeleton** created with `action.yml` and initial `dist/index.js`.
- **Basic overseer logic** implemented including posting PR summaries to the Memory Graph and creating followâ€‘up issues.
- **Todoist integration** reads API key from MCP config and optionally sends tasks.
- **CLI utility** (`bin/overseer.js`) allows running Overseer against a repository locally.
- **Roadmap automation** updates `ROADMAP.md` when pull requests are merged.
- **Jest tests** and CI workflow added, though dependencies are not currently installed in this environment.
- **VM setup script** (`setup_overseer_vm.sh`) provisions a machine with Node.js, MCP servers, and optional Docker.

## Outstanding Items

- The roadmap in `ROADMAP.md` still lists initial tasks that are not checked off. Ensure completed milestones are reflected here.
- CI configuration referenced in the roadmap is not present. Set up GitHub Actions or another CI system to run tests.
- Tests currently fail to execute because `jest` is not installed on the runner. Install dependencies or use a container with them preinstalled.
- Review `dist/index.js` for duplicate or obsolete code sections introduced by previous merges.

## Suggested Next Steps for Little Agents

1. **Update ROADMAP.md** to check off items that are already finished and add any new milestones.
2. **Establish continuous integration** so that running `npm test` succeeds in the project CI and ensures coverage.
3. **Clean up the compiled `dist/index.js`** file if needed, or ensure the build process generates a fresh file.
4. **Document configuration options** in more detail within README or a new `docs/` directory.
